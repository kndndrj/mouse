# Mouse PCB TODO

- Flip sensor 180 degrees (keep lens holes on exactly the same position!!!)
- Adjust encoder clearance (lower right corner touches a cap)
- Left and right expansion pins should have the same arrangement
- Do something with Boot0 pin (must be connected to GND - maybe through a button or a switch?)
- Connect encoder to timer input pins
